# Pentesting tools - A Brief Introduction
---

**Penetration testing** (or pentesting for short) is an essential process for identifying vulnerabilities in a system, network, or application. Penetration testing tools are used by cybersecurity professionals to simulate attacks and identify weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers. Two of the most popular penetration testing tools are Metasploit and Nmap, but there are many others that are also worth exploring.

> Distros such as [Kali](https://kali.org), [Parrot](https://www.parrotsec.org/) and [BlackArch](https://blackarch.org) include several tools such as `nmap` and the `Metasploit` framework to identify vulnerabilites in networks and for launching exploits against potentially vulnerable systems.

Two of the most popular penetration testing tools are Metasploit and Nmap, but there are many others that are also worth exploring.

## Metasploit: 
Metasploit is a popular open-source penetration testing tool that allows users to test the security of their network or application. It is widely used by security professionals because of its extensive database of exploits, payloads, and auxiliary modules.

Metasploit has a friendly and intuitive interface and is written in the Ruby programming language. It provides a range of modules that can be used for different purposes, including reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation.

Installing:
- Arch: `sudo pacman -S metsaploit`
- Fedora: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Metasploit

- Distro-agnostic: 
```wget https://downloads.metasploit.com/data/releases/metasploit-latest-linux-x64-installer.run
chmod +x ./metasploit-latest-linux-x64-installer.run 
./metasploit-latest-linux-x64-installer.run
```

## Nmap:
Nmap is another popular open-source tool that is used for network exploration and security auditing. It is a powerful tool that can be used to scan networks, identify hosts and services, and detect vulnerabilities.

Nmap can also be used to map out network devices and report open ports, providing some details such as what manufacturer, version, and operating system is being used. Nmap is written in C programming language and can be used on multiple platforms.

- Arch: `yay -S nmap`
- Fedora: `sudo yum install nmap`
- Debian: `sudo apt install nmap`

## Wireshark:
Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that is used by security professionals to monitor network traffic and identify potential security issues. It is an open-source tool that supports multiple platforms and protocols.

Wireshark can capture and analyze network packets and display them in a user-friendly format. It can be used to identify network vulnerabilities, troubleshoot network problems, and analyze network performance.

- Arch: `yay -S wireshark`
- Ubuntu:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wireshark-dev/stable
sudo apt update && sudo apt install wireshark
```
- Fedora:
```
sudo dnf install wireshark
```


## Burp Suite: 
Burp Suite is a set of *proprietary* tools used for web application security testing. It includes a proxy server, scanner, and intruder, among other tools, and is widely used by security professionals to identify vulnerabilities in web applications. Written in Java, Burpsuite can run on a variety of platforms.


- Arch, Ubuntu, Fedora: [Installation](https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/linux/install-burpsuite-community)

## John the Ripper: 
John the Ripper is a password cracking tool that is used to test the strength of passwords. It is a command-line tool that supports multiple platforms and password cracking techniques.John the Ripper can be used to perform dictionary attacks, brute-force attacks, and hybrid attacks to crack passwords.

- Arch:
```
sudo pacman -S john
```
- Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install john
```
- Fedora:
```
sudo dnf install john
```

## Sn1per:
Sn1per is an automated penetration testing tool that can be used for reconnaissance, scanning, and exploitation. It is a command-line tool that supports multiple platforms and is written in Bash scripting language. Sn1per can be used to identify vulnerabilities in web applications and networks and can also be used to launch automated attacks.

- Ubuntu:
```
git clone https://github.com/1N3/Sn1per
cd Sn1per
bash install.sh
```

- ArchLinux:

## Scapy:
Scapy is a packet manipulation tool that can be used for network testing and analysis. It is an open-source tool that supports multiple platforms and protocols. Scapy can be used to craft and send packets, sniff network traffic, and analyze network protocols.

## Nessus:
Nessus is a vulnerability scanner that is used to identify vulnerabilities in networks and systems. It is a commercial tool that supports multiple platforms and has a user-friendly interface. Nessus can be used to scan for vulnerabilities in web applications, networks, and operating systems, and provides detailed reports on the vulnerabilities found.

## Aircrack-ng:
Aircrack-ng is a set of tools that is used for wireless network security testing. It includes a packet sniffer, WEP and WPA/WPA2-PSK cracker, and analysis tool, among other tools. It is written in C.

## Hydra:
Hydra is a password cracking tool that is used to test the strength of passwords. It is a command-line tool that supports multiple protocols and services, including HTTP, FTP, and SSH. Hydra is **commonly used** on distros _such as Kali_ to perform password cracking through brute-force attacks.

## THC-Hydra:
THC-Hydra is a password cracking tool that is similar to Hydra, but with additional features and capabilities. It is a command-line tool that supports multiple protocols and services, including HTTP, FTP, and Telnet. THC-Hydra can be used to perform brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks to crack passwords.

## Wifite:
Wifite is a command-line tool used to audit WEP/WPA-encrypted wireless networks. It detects networks using the Aircrack-ng suite.It is designed to work with wireless interfaces that support monitor mode and packet injection. Wifite uses a combination of different tools such as Aircrack-ng, Reaver, and Pixiewps to automate the process of scanning, capturing, and cracking wireless networks. wWifite can:
- Automatically scan for available wireless networks and identify the ones that are vulnerable to attacks
-  Perform multiple attacks on a single network, including WPA/WPA2 cracking, WPS cracking, and rogue access point creation
- Allow users to customize their attacks by specifying target networks, attack methods, and other parameters
- Generate detailed reports of its findings, including the networks it scanned, the vulnerabilities it found, and the passwords it cracked
