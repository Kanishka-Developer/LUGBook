# VanillaOS: A Comprehensive Review
---

VanillaOS is a relatively new operating system that has been gaining attention in the tech community. It is a free and open-source operating system that is designed to be lightweight and fast, with a simple user interface. VanillaOS is built on top of the Linux kernel and is compatible with a wide range of hardware.

One of the most significant advantages of VanillaOS is its simplicity. The interface is clean and uncluttered, with a focus on ease of use. The design of the user interface is reminiscent of the classic Mac OS, with a dock at the bottom of the screen and a simple menu bar at the top. The simplicity of VanillaOS makes it a great option for users who are new to Linux or who prefer a more straightforward user interface.

VanillaOS uses [distrobox](https://distrobox.privatedns.org) and its in-house [apx](https://documentation.vanillaos.org/docs/apx/) to install, update and remove packages.

VanillaOS is an immutable distribution, which makes updates roll out as images that are layered on top of the existing image. This ensures that the OS is always in a consistent and recoverable state, which reduces file corruption and improves system stability.Further, as there are no updates to apply, deployment and maintenance is also an easy task. Other immutable distros include Fedora's Silverblue and Kinoite. These provide an effective way to containerize apps and to deploy reproducible builds of operating systems in a consistent manner.
