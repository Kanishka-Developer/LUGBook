# Arcolinux: A Comprehensive Review
---

Arcolinux is a Linux distribution that is based on Arch Linux. It is designed to provide a user-friendly and customizable desktop environment for both beginners and advanced users. The distribution is maintained by Erik Dubois and his team, who have made it their mission to provide a stable and reliable operating system that is easy to use and customize. It includes a dashboard app called [Arcolinux Welcome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHbswKpAlfs)

One of the key features of Arcolinux is its modular design. The distribution is divided into three main editions: the minimal edition, the Xfce edition, and the KDE Plasma edition. Each edition comes with a different set of pre-installed software and desktop environment, giving users the flexibility to choose the one that best fits their needs.

The distro consists of 4 ISO editions:

| ISO | Desktop     | Theming | Preinstalled software | Size        |
| --- | ---         | ---     |   ---                 | ---         |   
| S   | XFCE        | YES     | None                  | 1.7 GiB     |
| B   | Choose 1    | YES     | Minimal               | 1.6-1.9 GiB |
| D   | None        | NO      | None                  | 1.4 GiB     |
| L   | XFCE        | YES     | **LOTS**                | 2.4 GiB     |

The distro also maintains a configuration tool called the [Archlinux Tweak Tool](https://arcolinux.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-arcolinux-tweak-tool/), which serves to configure settings that are not present in every DE/WM, such as colourschemes and mirror configuration.

Additionally, Arcolinux also maintains a separate build of pamac, which reads from the Arco repositories.
Arcolinux also has a customized [Calamares installer](https://calamares.io) which provides extreme customizability during the install process.
