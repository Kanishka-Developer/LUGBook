Garuda Linux is a relatively new Linux distribution that was first released in 2020. It is being developed by [ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³] *Shrinivas Vishnu Kumbhar* and [ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª] *SGS*. Garuda refers to the vahana of Vishnu in Hindu mythology.

It is based on the Arch Linux distribution and aims to provide a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing experience for users. The developers of Garuda Linux have put a lot of effort into making the distribution easy to use and accessible to both new and experienced users. It uses [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) as the [init system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init).

Features of Garuda include:
- Archlinux base: 

    Garuda Linux is built on top of the Arch Linux distribution, which is known for its speed, flexibility, and powerful package manager.

- Rolling release model:

    Garuda Linux follows a rolling release model, which means that users receive continuous updates and new features without having to upgrade to a new version of the distribution.

- User-friendly installer:

    Garuda Linux offers a user-friendly installer that simplifies the installation process and lets users customize their setup based on their needs.

- Customized desktop environments: 

    Garuda Linux offers several customized desktop environments, including KDE Plasma, GNOME, Xfce, and LXQt. Each desktop environment has been customized to provide a unique and aesthetically pleasing experience.

- Performance optimizations: 

    Garuda Linux includes several performance optimizations out of the box, such as the use of the Zstandard compression algorithm and the BFQ I/O scheduler.

- Gaming-focused features: 

    Garuda Linux includes several gaming-focused features, such as the use of the Feral GameMode tool to optimize system performance during gaming sessions and the inclusion of several popular gaming emulators and tools.

A *disadvantage* with Garuda is that the graphical effects such as *blur* and *custom icon themes* - are generally CPU-intensive. The default spin, KDE Dr460nized, is known to consume nearly 1GiB of system memory (which is higher than what vanilla KDE Plasma takes.)
